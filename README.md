# Commodities Product Markup Language (CpML) #

Commodities Product Markup Language source code repository and documentation wiki.

The Commodities product Mark-up Language (CpML) is the energy trading industry standard that enables the representation of trades and other related information. 

The standard is widely used for electronic confirmation of OTC trades as well as regulatory reporting in Europe.

The key benefits of the CpML standard are:
- reduction of overall industry costs
- simplification and risk reduction of processes and systems
- competition and choice of technology and service providers 

The CpML standard is industry owned and governed, but open for participation and use by any interested parties at no cost. While focused
on Energy Trading, CpML is commercially-neutral and does not favor any particular technology or service. 

This repository contains the current release version as well as in-progress revisions open for comment and at-risk consumption.

The current released version of CpML - v5.3.0 is [here] (./v5.3.0)

The current draft specification of CpM - v5.3.1-draft is [here] (./v5.3.1-draft)
